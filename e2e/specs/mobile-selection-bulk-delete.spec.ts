/**
 * Mobile selection mode and search-scoped bulk delete (issue #92).
 *
 * The driving case the issue names: search "npm", long-press into selection
 * mode, select everything that matches, delete it. The highest-value claim in
 * this file is that the number the UI ever reports as *deleted* — the
 * completion banner, the partial-failure notice — always matches what
 * actually gets removed; every delete here is verified against the real
 * backend (message ids paged over the API, or subjects read straight off
 * IMAP), never against UI text alone. The confirm dialog's pre-delete count is
 * a labeled estimate, not that claim (#109): `countMatches` and the delete
 * itself re-page the same predicate independently, so mail arriving or
 * leaving in between can make the two disagree.
 *
 * Two things this harness cannot reproduce cheaply are worked around
 * deliberately, both noted where they're used:
 *
 * - The "search has more matches than are loaded" affordance only appears once
 *   a mailbox search's first (unbounded) page comes back with a
 *   `continuationToken` — which needs >500 real matching messages, since that
 *   is the server's default page size (`THREAD_SEARCH_MAX_LIMIT`). Seeding
 *   500+ IMAP messages just to flip one boolean is wasteful, so the
 *   escalation-availability trigger is forced via `page.route`, injecting a
 *   `continuationToken` into that one response. Everything downstream —
 *   `escalate()`'s own counting (a *different* request, paged at limit=100)
 *   and the delete it drives — is completely real against the messages seeded
 *   below and is never touched by the mock.
 * - Partial failure is simulated by mocking the bulk-delete endpoint's first
 *   response (the boundary the brief calls out) — the ids it reports failed
 *   are read back out of the real outgoing request, and Retry's follow-up call
 *   is left unmocked, so it actually deletes them.
